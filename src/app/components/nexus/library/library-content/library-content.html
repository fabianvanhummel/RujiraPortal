  <p class="story">
    The Omniverse is a dynamic and evolving world shaped by its lore and the
    choices of its citizens. This is not a fixed story. It is a growing universe
    where every discovery, decision, and achievement leaves a lasting impact.
    Scattered across the Omniverse are dormant regions, forgotten ruins, and
    ancient sources of energy waiting to be uncovered. While the lore team
    provides guidance for the major story arcs, the world itself will change
    based on community decisions. Faction outcomes, global events, and shared
    choices will shape how the story unfolds. As the Omniverse grows, so do its
    citizens. Traits may evolve, environments may shift, and new areas may
    unlock, all reflecting the progress and participation of the community. In
    the Omniverse, the story is not just observed. It is lived.

  <h2 class="m-0 subheader text">Tribes and communities</h2>
  <p class="story">
    The Omniverse is home to a wide variety of tribes and communities, each with
    its own culture, purpose, and place in the world. These groups shape the
    lore through their actions, alliances, and conflicts, and each plays a vital
    role in the ongoing story of the Omniverse. Some are builders, others are
    scholars, some protect, and others explore the unknown, but all contribute
    to the ever-evolving fabric of this universe.

  <h2 class="m-0 subheader text">The Runeborn</h2>
  <p class="story">
    The RuneBorn are a proud and enduring people who have made their home in
    Asgard, a city built with patience, strength, and the wisdom of generations.
    Life in Asgard is shaped by tradition and family. Over time, families have
    shifted, merged, risen, or disappeared. The number of RuneBorn families has
    never been fixed. Some lineages have endured for generations, while others
    have faded or been replaced. Each is led by a family head who carries its
    name, traditions, and place within the fabric of Asgard. For as long as
    memory reaches, the RuneBorn have lived by steady values. They believe in
    building what lasts and protecting what matters. Their way is not rushed.
    They do not chase every opportunity, nor do they fear what lies beyond. They
    focus on their home, their kin, and the quiet belief that time rewards those
    who endure. But not all within Asgard shared the same view of the future. In
    the years following the city's last great rebuilding, a rift began to form.
    A growing number of voices questioned whether the RuneBorn had become too
    cautious. Among them was Aaluxx, a respected builder and thinker who had
    spent years studying the old ways and the ancient designs left behind by
    those who came before. Aaluxx did not want to abandon the past, but he
    believed the RuneBorn were holding themselves back. He spoke of new lands,
    of open skies, and of energy sources left untouched. While some saw risk, he
    saw promise. Aaluxx obtained a copy of the original blueprint for the
    BiFrost with the full knowledge of the RuneBorn. It was not seen as an act
    of defiance, but as a natural step for those who wished to explore a
    different path. The BiFrost had always been more than a structure. It was a
    gateway to possibility, a symbol of connection between worlds. With the
    blueprint in hand, Aaluxx gathered families who shared his vision, those who
    felt a calling toward something beyond the borders of Asgard. Together, they
    formed a new group, and gave themselves a name: the Maya'kin. Their
    departure was not hidden, nor was it bitter. It was a farewell marked by
    respect. With well-wishes from those who remained, the Maya'kin set out into
    the wider Omniverse, choosing curiosity over certainty, and leaving behind a
    story that would be told for generations. The Maya'kin passed into the
    unknown, carrying their hopes and the plans for a new BiFrost. The RuneBorn
    remained. They continued to build and protect what they had always known.
    But questions lingered. What had Aaluxx seen? What did he hope to find?
    Search parties were sent, some returning with fragments of strange
    machinery, broken trail markers, and faint signs of movement. Others
    vanished without a trace. No message ever came. The Maya'kin were never
    heard from again. To this day, their fate is unknown. Some believe they
    discovered something beyond imagination and chose not to return. Others say
    they were lost to the dangers of the world. In Asgard, their story is
    remembered not as betrayal, but as a turning. One path split into two. One
    stayed rooted. The other chased the horizon. And the BiFrost, once a quiet
    monument, became something more. A reminder of choice, of possibility, and
    of the price of both.

  <h2 class="m-0 subheader text">Citizens</h2>
  <p class="story">
    The Citizens are the inhabitants of the Omniverse who have arrived from
    countless other universes. Each one carries their own traits, histories, and
    unique stories of where they come from. Despite their differences, they all
    come to this place in search of prosperity, purpose, and a new beginning.
